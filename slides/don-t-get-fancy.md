### Don't go chasing waterfalls

(Please stick to the patterns and practices you're used to.)

Note:

Likewise, as tempting as it is to stretch yourself a bit, be wary of the engineer who decides he or she needs to reinvent the wheel all the time.

Every time someone "disrupts the status quo", you're stuck maintaining that forever.
