## Understanding<br>Technical Debt

<aside class="notes"><p>Before we can address technical debt, we should understand what we&#39;re talking about.</p>
<p>If you ask 10 different engineers to define technical debt, somehow you&#39;ll get 15 different answers.</p>

### What is Technical Debt?

Challenges resulting from past decisions to favor <u>speed, simplicity, or cost</u> over<br><u>quality, maintainability, or robustness</u>

<aside class="notes"><p>For the sake of the talk today, we&#39;re going to define technical debt thusly.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, technical debt doesn&#39;t just mean &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;legacy&quot; code, either...</p>

### Technical Debt in the Real World

_Success + Tech Debt are not mutually exclusive!_

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Services on outdated servers/dependencies
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> "Legacy" applications

<aside class="notes"><p>Technical debt is everywhere:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many financial institutions still run on software written decades ago in COBOL, because the cost + risk of replacing these systems is so high<ul>
<li>Cheaper to pay handsome saleries to mainframe devs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>WordPress, by far the most popular PHP-based CMS, powers roughly 43% of the web (according to W3Techs)<ul>
<li>Only &quot;beta&quot; support for PHP 8.2 + 8.3, is &quot;compatible with exceptions&quot; for PHP 8.0 + 8.1</li>
<li>Part of the market strategy is making it easy to run WordPress <em>anywhere</em>, and cheap hosts aren&#39;t usually current on PHP</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Services you use every day, perhaps even to power your business, are often running outdated server software, dependencies, etc.<ul>
<li>Opportunity cost: what value could those engineers be driving instead of constantly updating?</li>

## Refactoring 101

<li>First, there are a few principles you should know and apply liberally as you refactor:</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Start with Tests

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Safety net for today and tomorrow
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Focus on the big picture
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Continuous Integration FTW!

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Before you change anything, you should make sure that you have good integration and/or e2e tests around your application<ul>
<li>Critical flows (signup, login, checkout, etc.) and the areas you&#39;re working on</li>
<li>These act as guardrails or a safety net, ensuring that you don&#39;t accidentally break anything as you refactor</li>
<li>Tests will then live on, aiding in future refactors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Focus more on integration + e2e tests; individual functions/methods may change considerably, so unit tests are less helpful here<ul>
<li>Write tests as you write new code during the refactor (including unit tests!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These tests should be run as part of your CI pipeline on every push<ul>
<li>Don&#39;t have a CI pipeline? No time like the present!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

### Static Code Analysis

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Inspect your code without running it
    * [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org), [Phan](https://github.com/phan/phan), [Psalm](https://psalm.dev/)
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Find type + logical errors
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Tune it to avoid a firehose!

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Static code analysis is a method of analyzing your code without having to run it</li>
<li>Great at catching logical errors, type issues, etc.<ul>
<li>Many can also help you identify dead code paths</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Turning it on without tuning will hurt your feelings</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
#### Tuning Static Code Analysis

1. <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Unknown classes/functions/methods, wrong number of args, etc.
2. <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Potentially undefined vars, invalid PHPDocs
3. <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Unreachable code, conditionals that will always pass/fail
4. <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Strict types, etc.

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Most static code analysis tools let you dial in the things you care about</li>
<li>If you&#39;re just introducing static code analysis, start with the lowest level and, as you address (or suppress) issues, you can turn this up</li>
</ul>

### Backfill Documentation

![George McFly, writing in his notepad while talking to Marty, saying "I'm writing this down, this is good stuff."](resources/writing-this-down.gif)

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>As you begin digging into the old, crusty code don&#39;t be afraid to take notes on your findings!<ul>
<li>Writing inline docs can help you keep track of your findings both today and tomorrow</li>
<li>Remember to capture not only the how, but the <em>why</em>!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Documentation-only PRs are not only very low-risk, but also help you and other members of your team follow along.</li>
<li>Adding docblocks also helps static code analysis tools better analyze your code</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### The Power of Package Managers

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Manage direct + intermediary dependencies
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Negotiates version constraints, conflicts
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Easily see what's out of date

<aside class="notes"><p>Whenever possible, leverage the appropriate package manager for your language&#39;s ecosystem. In PHP that&#39;s Composer, and we&#39;re so lucky to have it!</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow you to install and update dependencies, including any intermediary dependencies</li>
<li>Negotiates version constraints and conflicts with other packages</li>

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Composer can tell us which of our dependencies don&#39;t claim to support PHP 8.3</li>

### Step Debugging

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Pause your code at certain points
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Inspect values, dig into function calls
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Worth the effort to configure!

<aside class="notes"><p>If you really want to level up your refactoring game, learn to use a step debugger like Xdebug</p>
<ul>
<li>Allows you to set breakpoints and freeze the execution when you reach it</li>
<li>From there, you can inspect the values of different variables, see the current stacktrace, and then progress through your code, one step at a time</li>
<li>Can be challenging to get set up, but way more powerful than die debugging</li>

### Committed libraries

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Replace with copy managed by Composer
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Consider modern replacements

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Not uncommon to come across apps with <code>lib</code> directories (or similar), full of third-party code <strong>not</strong> managed by a tool like Composer<ul>
<li>Congratulations, you&#39;ve effectively adopted that dependency!</li>
<li>Updates, conflicts, patches, and bugs are now your responsibility</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When possible, you want to use an appropriate package manager (e.g. Composer)</li>
<li>If the library predates Composer, you may want to start looking for more modern solutions<ul>
<li>You can ease this transition with the Adapter Pattern</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
#### Adapter Pattern

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Define an interface, then write library-specific implementations
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Makes it easier to swap out underlying libraries with minimal interruption
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Easier to test individual implementations

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Design pattern where you define a common interface, then write lightweight wrappers that implement those interfaces using different underlying libraries<ul>
<li>For example, the symfony-mailer package defines the <code>MailerInterface</code>, and there are multiple adapters you can use (Mandrill, Postmark, Sendgrid, etc.)</li>
<li>Application code has been decoupled from and isn&#39;t concerned with which implementation its given, just the <code>MailerInterface</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Switching (for example) from Postmark to Sendgrid is a matter of configuration, not changes to the actual sending code</li>
<li>Makes it easier to test individual implementations</li>

### Spaghetti Code

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Step debuggers will be a huge help!
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Extract what you can

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Code that&#39;s difficult to navigate through, like a big plate of spaghetti<ul>
<li>Often the result of poorly thought-out or ever-changing business requirements</li>
<li>Causes developers to waste a lot of time sorting things out</li>
<li>Difficult to onboard into</li>
<li>Breeding ground for tough-to-track-down bugs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As usual, start with tests<ul>
<li>The harder the code is to follow, the more important it is that you have broad, e2e tests</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A step debugger is worth its weight in gold when navigating a noodly codebase</li>
<li>As you can, find ways to extract pieces into standalone classes or methods that you can more-easily test</li>

<li>Data goes in and comes out, but nobody&#39;s sure <em>how</em> it works</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In many ways, approach black boxes as you would spaghetti code: tests, step debugging, and writing docs as you go</li>
<li>Try to focus first on the big picture (what it&#39;s trying to do), then narrow in on the &quot;how&quot;</li>
<li>Try not to get burninated!</li>

### @todo comments

```php
/**
 * @todo WTF is going on here?! 😱
 */
```

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li><code>@todo</code> comments aren&#39;t inheriently-evil, but can be good indicator of incomplete/buggy code</li>
<li>Try to be as descriptive as possible; can this be linked to a Jira ticket or something?</li>

### Dealing with Bad Tests

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Focus on the what, not the how
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Refactor tests or code (not both)
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Strict equality
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Tests are not infallible!

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>When writing or refactoring tests, remember that the goal is to ensure our code behaves the way we expect; how it works internally isn&#39;t the focus<ul>
<li>When people are just learning how to test (or worse, are told &quot;you must have tests for everything&quot; without guidance), they often fall into the trap of testing the implementation, not the intended behavior<ul>
<li>Basically just writing the code twice, which defeats the purpose</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If I were to unit test your walk to lunch, I might say &quot;when this person walks out the door, then they will arrive in the lunch line&quot; my test will still be valid regardless of whether or not you drop off your backpack or chat with a friend</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When refactoring, focus on tests <em>or</em> on code, but not both at the same time<ul>
<li>Either let the production code that (allegedly) works guide you, or let the tests be your guide</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use strict comparisons whenever possible<ul>
<li>For no extra effort, let PHP type system warn you when things go awry</li>
<li>If you find yourself putting a try/catch block in a test and it&#39;s not to do some heavy introspection on the exception you expect to catch...that&#39;s probably a bad sign</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When you&#39;re refactoring, you may find that a test breaks when even the smallest thing changes in the code<ul>
<li>Don&#39;t be afraid to question the validity of the test! It may have been too-tightly coupled to the original implementation.</li>
<li>Tests are not written in stone!</li>

#### The True Meaning of Code Coverage

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> See which parts of your app are covered (and what isn't)
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> What the <abbr title="Change-Resistant Anti-Pattern">CRAP</abbr>?
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> <code>@covers</code> to avoid false-positives

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>PHPUnit (and other test runners) can generate code coverage reports, which show you exactly which lines are touched—and which are not—when you run your test suite<ul>
<li>Hot take: code coverage percentages are a terrible metric</li>
<li>Better to have 50% coverage with really solid tests than 100% with garbage</li>
<li>Instead, focus on which areas of your app lack coverage: those are higher risk!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the HTML version of PHPUnit&#39;s code coverage, there&#39;s a nice dashboard showing the areas that need the most attention<ul>
<li>Change-Resistant Anti-Patterns (CRAP): areas that are most likely going to cause you pain as you refactor</li>
<li>Which areas are lacking coverage and/or are especially complex?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Using the <code>@covers</code> annotation tells PHPUnit &quot;this test class covers this part of the app&quot;<ul>
<li>Prevents unrelated code from picking up coverage unintentionally</li>
<li>May lower the coverage %, but improves accuracy</li>

### Branching for special cases

Panel two continues, with the developer stating "It's a self-service SaaS, we can't handle individual requests" while the PM reasons "Come on...just a tiny IF. A ridiculously tiny IF...". In panel three, the PM continues "It's one of our biggest customers...I'll owe you one!". The developer hesitates, saying "I shouldn't...".

</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
#### Why do we want to do this?

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> PHP 8 is more powerful and faster
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> PHP 7.x is EOL (security risk)

<aside class="notes"><p>Just because we&#39;re going to PHP 8 doesn&#39;t mean we have to use all of its features on day one.</p>
<p>Notice we didn&#39;t mention anything about, for example, ripping out that old enum library and using PHP&#39;s native enums. One thing at a time!</p>

#### How will we address this?

1. <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Install/upgrade static code analysis tools
2. <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Resolve issues caught by static code analysis, test suite(s)
3. <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Pre-prod testing w/ PHP 8.3
4. <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Slow-roll 8.3 image across hosts
5. <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Clean up PHP 7.x leftovers

<aside class="notes"><p>Now we know what we&#39;re hoping to accomplish, so now we need to determine how we get there</p>
<ol>
<li>If we already have a static code analysis tool, make sure it&#39;s current.<ul>
<li>If not, now would be a good time to install one</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tell the tool that we&#39;re targeting PHP 8 and let it tell us where we might have issues. Then get the tests running on PHP 8<ul>
<li>Good test suites will cover large portions of the app</li>
<li>No tests? This would be a very good time to start!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Next, we want to manually test things<ul>
<li>If you have a QA team, they&#39;ll be vital here</li>
<li>Involve SMEs to ensure things continue to work as expected</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finally, start rolling out PHP 8 on production<ul>
<li>If possible, don&#39;t upgrade all servers at once</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once you&#39;re on PHP 8, clean up any PHP 7-specific paths you may have added</li>
</ol>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
#### How do we measure success?

1. <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> All app servers are running PHP 8.3
2. <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> All Composer dependencies are up-to-date
3. <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> No unscheduled downtime or production errors related to upgrade

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>You may notice, a lot of these metrics match our described, ideal state</li>
<li>Gives your managers clear numbers, e.g.:<ul>
<li>All 50 servers are now running the latest version of PHP</li>
<li>All 20 direct and 80 intermediate Composer dependencies are up to date</li>
<li>0 minutes of unscheduled maintenance</li>
<li>0 incidents</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Having these numbers makes it very easy for them to say &quot;yes&quot; the next time you propose a refactor!</li>

### Recognize Trade-offs

How likely is it that taking<br>the easy way now will bite us later?

<aside class="notes"><ul>

### Code review

![Lisa Simpson, desperate for attention from Marge (or anyone, really), hopping up and down pleading "Grade me! Look at me! Evaluate and rank me!"](resources/lisa-grade-me.gif)

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>If it isn&#39;t already, make code review a required part of your team&#39;s development workflow.</li>
<li>Not only does it help catch bugs before they reach production, but it ensures you&#39;re not the only one who understands how the app works.</li>
<li>Code reviews should include documentation: if a PR changes the way something works it must also include the relevant documentation updates!</li>
</ul>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Embrace Coding Standards

A good codebase reads like it was written by a team that was on the same page.

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Coding standards help keep the codebase organized and readable</li>
<li>Not just spaces v. tabs, but procedural v. OOP, namespaces, organization, etc.</li>
<li>Enforce standards with tools like PHP_CodeSniffer and PHP Coding Standards Fixer</li>

#### Write code that's easy to follow

### Write tests as you go

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Test-Driven Development
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Regression tests to fix bugs

<aside class="notes"><p>Touched on this earlier, but it&#39;s not one of my talks without me harping on testing!</p>
<ul>
<li>If you&#39;re able, embrace TDD<ul>
<li>Write tests first to describe the feature, then write the code necessary to make the tests pass</li>
<li>Encourages more thoughtful design patterns</li>
<li>Built-in defense against unintended changes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When fixing bugs, start the same way:<ul>
<li>Write tests to reproduce the bugs (tests should fail)</li>
<li>Fix the bug (tests should pass)</li>
<li>The test then protects against future regressions</li>

### Plan for updates

![Geordi La Forge meme where he rejects "wait too long, apply tons of updates at once" in favor of "update incrementally on a regular cadence"](resources/geordi.jpg)

<aside class="notes"><p>Remember that technical debt is a slow boil, so make sure you&#39;re giving yourself time for updates.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#39;s a day at the end of your sprint or some time at the end of the month, but set an upgrade cadence and stick to it</p>

### No Two Ways About It!

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>On a larger codebase, it&#39;s not uncommon to have multiple libraries that do the same thing.<ul>
<li>Maybe two teams installed Libraries A and B independently, but now there are two ways to do the same thing</li>
<li>Worse yet, another engineer comes in and implements Library C, making the count three!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Have some sort of central location (wiki, spreadsheet, etc.) that outlines which libraries are available, where they&#39;re being used, and where to go to get further details.</li>
<li>Another place where the adapter pattern can help: if people aren&#39;t interacting with the libraries directly (just your interface), it matters a lot less</li>

## So, what have we learned?

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Technical debt is a part of life
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Watch for red flags
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Identify, plan, execute
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Test early, test often
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Be empowered—not hindered—by open-source

<aside class="notes"><ul>
<li>Technical debt is a part of life, but by making good decisions we can minimize its impact.<ul>
<li>It&#39;s only a problem if it&#39;s costing you time, money, and/or sanity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ever vigilent, always watching for red flags we discussed (spaghetti code, committed libraries, bad tests, branching for special cases, dead code, etc.)</li>
<li>Identify <em>what</em> you want to solve, then make a plan</li>
<li>A solid test suite is worth its weight in gold<ul>
<li>E2E and integration tests at the start help ensure your app doesn&#39;t break as you refactor</li>
<li>Write regression tests as you fix things</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Take advantage of well-tested, documented, and maintained open source projects, but do so in a way that you&#39;re not tightly coupled to them<ul>
<li>Manage them using dependency managers</li>
<li>Have a reason for everything you install</li>
